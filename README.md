Angular MultiSelect
==
An AngularJS directive which creates a dropdown button with multiple or single selections. 
Allows you to customize your labels and use some HTML tags in the data. Fully configurable through element attributes and CSS.
Doesn't require jQuery and works well with other Javascript libraries.

If you have any problem, just open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select">https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select</a>.<br />
This directive is a practical solution, not a performance champion. It will not win any code efficiency competition.<br />
Pardon some incorrect HTML highlighting in this document. Apparently highlight.js breaks when it sees on-open="function()" etc.<br />
If you like / use this directive in your awesome projects, star this repo. It's a huge motivation for me. Would also love to hear from you if you use it in an open source project. Thanks!<br />
