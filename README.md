Angular MultiSelect

An AngularJS directive which creates a dropdown button with multiple or single selections. 
Allows you to customize your labels and use some HTML tags in the data. Fully configurable through element attributes and CSS.
Doesn't require jQuery and works well with other Javascript libraries.

Note

I'm a Github newbie so pardon me if you experience weird commit / forking sequence =)
<br />I'm all ears for new development ideas. Just open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select">https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select</a>.
<br />Kindly let me know if you use this directive in your projects -just open a new issue in Github- it's a huge motivation for me. Thanks!
